DESCRIPTIVE ABSTRACT:

	These data contain information from a 1 - 3 matched design studying
the risk factors associated with benign breast disease.  The data is comprised
of a subset of large study in which the original data are from a hospital
based case-control study designed to examine the epidemiology of fibrocystic
breast disease.  Data are provided on 50 women who were diagnosed as having
benign breast disease and 150 age matched controls, with three controls per
case.  Matching was based on the age of the subject at the time of interview.

	Cases included women with a biopsy-confirmed diagnosis of fibrocystic
breast disease identified through two hospitals in New Haven, Connecticut.
Controls were selected from among patients admitted to the general surgery,
orthopedic, or otolaryngologic services at the same two hospitals. Trained
interviewers administered a standardized structured questionnaire to collect
information from each subject [see Pastides et. al. (1983) and Pastides,
et al. (1985)].
