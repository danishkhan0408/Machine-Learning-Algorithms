Random Forest:
-Used for both Classification and Regression
-Works best for Classification
-Called an "Ensemble classifier" ie many models working together
-Collection of many decision trees, whose average is taken
-each dt is callled a bag
-by default 500 bags are created, can be specified manually as well
-no overfit problem
-each dt built need not be trimmed
-can have max number of columns
-can have bad values (try to avoid them)
-Multicollinear values must be removed after check
-uses bootstrap method to select samples


Bootstrapping
1.Bagging:
-a random sampling with replacement
-samples are also called out of bag samples
-models are build in parallel

DT is better than RF when the variables are binary in nature
