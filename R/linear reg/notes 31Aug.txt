linear regression
-to predict continous outcome. eg stock prices, temp, profits, weight, etc

y= variable to be predicted ie dependent variable
x= independent variable/feature
Best fit lines draws the best prediction for given values

Method 1
-Squaring the errors (method of least squares)-> gives e1
method 2 -> gives e2
if e2<e1, the method 2 is a better model as it has reduced the error

Goal of Linear Regression is to build a model that reduces the SSE (sum of square error) and plot the best fit line

equation:
y=a+bn*xn
y= value to be predicted
a= intercept
bn= slope of the line
xn= independent variable

a,b calc by 1. Stochastic Gradient Descent method (preferred)
            2. OLS ordinary least square method - done statistically

for selecting best fit line:
1. must pass throught the centroid of the data
2. the SSE should be the least

Causal relationship if x causes y

Model 1 = e1 = 960
Model 2 = e2 = 230 - SSE (least among s1 and s2)
e1-e2=730= SSR - Sum of Squared errors due to Regression
SST= total sum of Square error = SSE + SSR = 930

y= actual
y^ hat= predicted
y bar= mean

Linear regresssion ass
Asumptions
1. Regression model is liner in its coeffs (y is linear with b)  y=a + b1x1 + b2(x2^2) + ... with X raised to 1 or 2.
2. Mean f residuals (of the linear models) is 0 or near 0
3. residuals have equal variance (homoscedasticity)
4. Residuals are normally distributed
5. X variables and residuals are not related
6. No of obvs must be greater than no of X (rows>columns)
7. no outliers
8. Variability in x values is positive, X values in the given sample are not the same

Feature selection:
1.Remove- sequential data, free form text
2.Multicollinearity check (x1, x2, etc are interrelated)
3.Singularities
4.model building
5. summarize the model(hypothesis testing)
