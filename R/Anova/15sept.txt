ANOVA: Analysis Of Variance
1. Among variance: distance from the overall mean
2. Around: internal distance

F ratio= [n1 sum(x1-X)^2 + n2 sum(x2-X)^2 + ...] / (k-1)
         -------------------------------------------------
         [(sum(x1i - x1)^2 + (sum(x2i - x1)^2 + ...]/(N-k)
         
        n = number of observations of each sample
	xn = sample of each mean
	X = mean of all sample means
	k = total number of sample groups

kNN k Nearest Neighbour:
-Uses Euclidean distance formula to determine the nearest neighbour
-Used for classification and regression

For continous variables:
1. Euclidean distance (slow)
2. Manhattan distance (default)
3. Minowski distance

For categorical variables
1. Hamming distance

Standardization is done to restric the data between 0 and 1 to reduce computation time and complexity
Standardization technique:
1. z score
2. logit
3. MinMax 

MinMax = [x - min(x)] / [max(x) - min(x)]

k range 3 to 11 (usually)
Classification: k= odd value is selected
